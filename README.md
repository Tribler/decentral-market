# tsukiji
Tsukiji is a decentralised market. Users can create bids and asks in a decentralised manner, similar to bittorrent. Without a central point of failure, it will prove more resistant to hostile takeover. Tsukiji is still a proof-of-concept in the early stages of development.

Tsukiji market is also the largest fish and seafood market in the world, located in Tokyo.
